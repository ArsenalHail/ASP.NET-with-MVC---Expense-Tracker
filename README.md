# ASP.NET-with-MVC---Expense-Tracker
A beginner program designed to get myself used to the .NET infrastructure through Visual Studio development.

The program simulates a website with three pages - a home page, a page for adding/removing/editing an expense, and a page for viewing all expenses. Expenses with the same id overwrite each other (editing), so if an expense named Netflix and id 1 has the same id, the new entry will overwrite the old one. All changes and values are saved on a database locally simulated on memory.

This program primarily served as an exercise for me to get used to web development and making calls to and from a database. While not extensive in nature (the html is barely customized, and the database is simulated), it successfully stores and references changes in data from the user interacting with the web page.
